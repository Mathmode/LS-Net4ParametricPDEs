# LS-Net for Parametric PDEs

This repository provides three numerical examples to verify the theory of the LS-Net method: (a) a damped harmonic oscillator, (b) a one-dimensional Helmholtz equation with impedance boundary conditions, and (c) a two-dimensional transmission problem. 
To reproduce the reported results in our paper or to train the network for each numerical example, please follow these steps:

1. Execute `Main.py` to generate and save model or CSV data in `Saved_models`.
2. Run `plot.py` to generate the final graphics.
